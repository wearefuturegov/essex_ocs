        - remove clutter, trailing wires and frayed carpet
        - use non-slip mats and rugs
        - use high-wattage light bulbs in lamps and torches, so you can see clearly
        - organise your home so that climbing, stretching and bending are kept to a minimum, and to avoid bumping into things
        - try not to walk on slippery floors in socks or tights
        - wear well-fitting shoes that are in good condition and support the ankle.
        - take care of your feet by trimming your toenails regularly and seeing a GP or chiropodist about any foot problems
